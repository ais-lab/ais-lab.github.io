At "Ibaraki x Ritsumeikan DAY 2025," we exhibited our research and robots at SP LAB 8. We had visitors of a wide range of ages, and the children's reactions were particularly refreshing and memorable. It was a valuable opportunity for people to feel closer to the AIS Laboratory. Thank you very much to everyone who came.
