On October 27, 2025, Mr. Byoung Soo Kim, the CEO of ROBOTIS, visited Our Lab.
It was a valuable opportunity for our students to present demonstrations of their ongoing research directly to the CEO.
Having the chance to show our research outcomes and discuss them with the head of a world-leading company was a very stimulating and valuable experience for the students.
Thank you very much, Mr. Byoung Soo Kim, for your valuable time!
