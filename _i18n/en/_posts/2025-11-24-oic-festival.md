We held a research demonstration at SP LAB 8 during the OIC Festival (Ritsumeikan University School Festival 2025)!
We showcased demonstrations such as home appliances operating automatically in response to human actions and instructions, as well as a robot that delivers items to people who raise their hands!
The booth was a huge success, and many visitors were able to experience the technology firsthand.
Thank you to everyone who stopped by!
