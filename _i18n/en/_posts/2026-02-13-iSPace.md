We were delighted to welcome the members of the Technical Committee on iSpace to AIS Lab. recently!
We had the chance to showcase our latest research results through live demos.
Receiving sharp questions and direct feedback from the experts was a huge inspiration for all of us. We are excited to use this advice to improve our technology and push our research even further!
A big thank you to everyone who visited and made this possible!
