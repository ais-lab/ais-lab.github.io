[Research Presentations and Award Winner at the R-GIRO Symposium!]
The R-GIRO FY2025 Annual Performance Report Meeting was held recently, where five students from the Li Lab presented their research. It was a valuable opportunity for them to share the results of their daily hard work with the academic community.
We are also proud to announce that Matsushita (D1) received the Group 2 Poster Presentation Award!
Congratulations on this well-deserved achievement!
